In [their] other words: _This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon my work non-commercially, as long as they credit me and license their new creations under the identical terms._ So, have at it (but don't get paid off of it), and credit a bro for the original steeze. Plus, whatever is made, needs to be made available for other to freak and tweak as well in the same way.
