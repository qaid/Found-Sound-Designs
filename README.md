What the Hell Is This? There's no code (a/k/a the Introduction)
===============================================================

It's true, this isn't a traditional code-based project. Instead, this is largely an opportunity for me to continue to expand my Git skills by using a version control system around my graphic design. (And in the case of this document, my Markdown skills.) I also wanted an opportunity to dig into the Github API to see if I can creatively display the design process around this project on webpages.

Even more interestingly, I supposed there's also a chance this could be an experiment in collaborative design if others become interested in this and want to contribute or fork their own visions for these design materials. I'm totally open to that. [The License][1] below should be able to take care of any confusing situations that might arise.

Requirements
------------
I created these graphics using super-expensive [Adobe Illustrator][3], so ostensibly one would need that program, but there are a number of other alternatives out there for vector editing:
### Free
- [Inkscape][4]
- [Skencil][5]
- [Creative Docs. NET][6]
- [DrawPlus][7]

### Not Free (Mac OS)
- [Keynote][8]
- [iDraw][9]
- [Artboard][10]
- [Sketch][11]

Contributing / Freaking
-----------------------
If you're interested in remixing or freaking these designs - either for our use in promoting the Found Sound event through graphic design artifacts, or for your own use ... um, just go ahead. Oh, actually, I'd like to be able to see and perhaps even remix your remixes, so I guess the thing would be to FORK the project.

If you have design improvements you want to make to these original designs, then request a commit - I think. Right? Or something. You may know better than I (at this point).

Plus, whatever is made, needs to be made available for other to freak and tweak as well in the same way.
